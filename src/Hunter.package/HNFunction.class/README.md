TODO: Differentiate between arrow function and plain function.

Not this class responsibility, but think of a way of getting the function name  (this function is assigned to only one variable, or to an object property, so it's "method"-like, etc.)

----

Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.
