I am Hunter AST processor. My responsibility is to annotate each Identifier occurrence in the AST with the scope that it belongs; so that further processors should know exactly which actual variable an identifier is bound to. This a  100% accurate process. All the guessing heuristics (necessary when dealing with object properties, that unfortunately are so common in JavaScript) must be dealed in another processor (HNScopeValueBinder).
